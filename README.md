#### _Determines if words are anagrams or antigrams, February 9th, 2018_

#### By _**David Lewis**_

## Description

_This program takes two words from the user and determines whether the letters match regardless of order. If none of the letters match then the program will return that the two words are antigrams. If all the letters match then the program will return that the words are anagrams. The program also checks if the words have vowels. If no vowels are present then the program returns a message that no words were entered._
